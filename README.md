Make mass letters with different recipient names

To provide recipient's name, write the names in **Input/invited_names.txt** file. Each name must be on a new line.

For starting letter, there is an **Input/starting_letter.txt** file. You can modify it, but the file must contains text "[name]" in order to replace with recipient's name.

The results of the letters are in the **Output** folder
